# MIT Sloan Web Development Department

Welcome to the MIT Sloan Web Development Department, a department within the Office of Communications.

## Goal

The driving goal of our department is to...

**Use technology to share MIT Sloan with the world**

We strive to meet this goal by building and maintaining the public facing web properties for MIT Sloan and its community. Providing the tools that allow the knowledge and expertise within MIT Sloan be presented to the world.

## About This Space

This Github organization is one of the ways to work towards that goal, using it to collaborate on code that powers some of our websites and applications.

### Not for public use

Sorry, but our codebases are not for public consumption. If you have a question about the work we are doing, you can reach us a oc.webdev.mitsloan@mit.edu
